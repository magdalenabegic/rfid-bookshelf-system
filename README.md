# Smart bookshelf project

Please note that this project is currently in the development stage and is a work in progress. 

The idea for this project emerged from my experiences during the first two years of my studies when I worked in a library. 

This project is part of the final assignment for IoT (Internet of Things) program at VERN' University. While it's not yet complete, I've chosen to keep this repository visible on my profile to provide transparency about the ongoing work.

## Project Description

Libraries play one of the most crucial roles in educational institutions, and there should be a continuous effort towards their modernization. The term "smart" implies more efficient, flexible, and organized solutions with the integration of digital processes.

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent library system using RFID technology and a Raspberry Pi computer. The system will feature a software/admin interface for librarians to manage and monitor the library's book inventory. The library will consist of three shelves for the presentation/prototype.

Instead of relying on traditional bookshelf organization, the RFID technology will enable precise tracking of each book's location on the shelves. Librarians will be able to view the current books on each shelf in real-time through the software interface. Additionally, the system will generate comprehensive reports and analytics, including charts, to provide insights into book usage patterns.

By leveraging RFID technology and IoT (Internet of Things), librarians can gain valuable insights into the library's operations. They can identify which shelves are most frequently accessed, track book circulation trends, and analyze which books are underutilized. This data-driven approach enhances the overall efficiency and organization of the library, allowing librarians to make informed decisions to optimize the library's resources and improve the user experience.
